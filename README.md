# CS230-Operating-Platforms-

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client has a game application for Android systems. They want to expand the game application to other platforms using a distributed system. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I researched the different operating systems and then I explained the differences between the operating platforms very well. I laid out everything in a way that is easy to comprehend.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through the design document gave me a better understanding of what was needed. The design document was a sort of blueprint or checklist that gave me something to look at for reference. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation and recommendation parts of the design document. I would go into more detail in the evaluation and break down the pros and cons further. In the recommendation part I would explain some of the details more in depth.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users are going to need to have access to the software from many different platforms and will not want to wait for the software to load. I implemented these needs by looking at a reliable platform that has good memory management. It is important because the users are the ones who will be using the software. You must look at the user's point of view as well as the clients. Without the users, the client's software will not be used so the users need to be considered and what they may need.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by looking at what the client needed. I looked to see what system fit their needs the best based on research of each system. In the future I would look at what the client needs and break them down into different parts. I would see what system fit each needs best and then see what system fit the most. I would also add what needs are higher priority than other needs. This will make sure that if a need cannot be met fully it will be one of lower priority.
